### Project Title
Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This Python script is written for Project 2 of Udacity's PDSND and is used to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from .csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. In this project, I have used data provided by Udacity portal. I have compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. I have uploaded a copy of the datasets here https://drive.google.com/open?id=16FfhNDfAh0DvTIRw9r0plmWZlHPEcBa4.
